The project implements features listed in the rubric doc. App id is ivory-streamer-101306

Task 1:
==============================
1. Session is implemented as a kind, and speaker is implemented as a simple string. Please refer
to models.py for details.

2. The following endpoints API methods are implemented for this task:
getConferenceSessions
getConferenceSessionsByType
getSessionsBySpeaker
createSession

3. The Conference kind is the ancestor of Session kind.


Task 2:
==============================
1. Similar to the way conference created is implemented, added a sessionKeysInterested property
in the Profile kind to store keys of sessions user are interested in.


Task 3:
==============================
1. The query problem is solved by the following endpoints API method:
querySpecificSessions

Since there're two inequality filters, they cannot be applied at the same time. To resolve the
issue, applied one filter first and then filtered the result returned in memory.

2. A generic method querySessions() is implemented to execute other querys. Similar to method
queryConference(), it could apply multiple filters. For example:

a) Session start time no earlier than 10am: startTime <= 10
b) Search sessions in a paticular city, eg. London: city == 'London'


Task 4:
==============================
1. Added two string arrays in Conference, speakers and featured

a) speakers stores any speaker has a session in this conference
b) featured stores speakers have more than one session in this conference

When a session is added to the conference, check whether speaker is in 'speakers' first. If no,
add him/her to 'speakers'. If yes, it means he/she has more than one sessions. Add name and
session to memcache, and check whether the speaker is in 'featured'. If not, add him/her to
'featured' as well.

2. The getFeaturedSpeaker() method just retrieves the featured list and returns it in the correct
form.
